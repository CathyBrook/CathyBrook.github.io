I am an Assistant Beamline Scientist at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, currently working at the spectroscopy group, supporting and being involved in the beamline activities at 25-ID, 20-BM and 9 BM. With a multidisciplinary background in physics, material science, and chemistry. My research focuses on developing synchrotron techniques, especially regarding X-ray spectroscopy and spectral imaging techniques, and applying them in fundamental science.
